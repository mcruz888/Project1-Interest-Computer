In this project, I was able to make a detailed interest computer that calculates the profit a person makes. It takes in inputs for principal, interest as a percentage, the amount of times compounded, and the amount of years. It will then calculate all the inputs to find the compound interest, which will then subtract it from the inputed principal to find the profit.
